---

## Greykite Architecture

### 1. **Silverkite Algorithm**
The core of Greykiteâ€™s architecture is the **Silverkite algorithm**. It combines traditional statistical models like ARIMA with features typically used in machine learning, such as handling holidays and external events.
- **Linear Model Framework**: Silverkite uses a linear model, but it is flexible enough to include seasonality, holidays, and other event-based effects through feature engineering.
- **Lasso Regularization**: For feature selection and reducing overfitting, the Silverkite model leverages **Lasso** regularization.
- **Automatic Seasonality Detection**: Detects weekly, monthly, and yearly seasonality patterns automatically based on historical data.

### 2. **Flexible Feature Engineering**
Greykite offers highly flexible **feature engineering** techniques, including:
- **Time Features**: Automatically generates time-related features (hour, day of the week, month, etc.).
- **Holiday and Event Features**: Integrates holiday effects, promotions, and other events into the forecast.
- **External Regressors**: Greykite allows users to add additional covariates (like weather, traffic, etc.) as external regressors to improve forecasting accuracy.

### 3. **Model Explainability**
Greykite emphasizes model interpretability by providing insights into:
- **Feature Importance**: Ranking of time-related features, holidays, and external regressors.
- **Decomposition of Effects**: Breaks down the contribution of each component (seasonality, holidays, trends) to the final forecast.

## Growth Functions and Trend Components

Greykite provides extensive support for modelling growth patterns and trends in time series data. The **Silverkite** model uses the following growth functions and trend models:

### 1. **Linear Growth**
   - **Formula**: 
   
   $$ y(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot t $$

   This is a simple linear trend where the forecast grows or shrinks steadily over time.

### 2. **Logarithmic Growth**
   - **Formula**: 
   
   $$ y(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \log(t) $$

   This growth model captures diminishing returns, where the rate of growth slows down over time but never truly flattens.

### 3. **Exponential Growth**
   - **Formula**: 
   
   $$ y(t) = \beta_0 \cdot e^{\beta_1 \cdot t} $$

   Commonly used in scenarios where the growth rate accelerates over time, such as viral spread or technology adoption.

### 4. **Piecewise Linear Growth**
   - Allows for **knot-based** specification where different growth rates can be specified for different time segments. This is especially useful for capturing sudden changes in trends, such as policy changes or market shifts.
   - Example: Growth accelerates during holiday seasons or after a product launch.

### 5. **Custom Growth Functions**
   - Users can define their growth functions by leveraging **external regressors** that influence trends. For instance, economic indicators, marketing spend, or competitor actions can be modeled as growth components.
