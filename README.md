## Greykite Architecture

### 1. **Silverkite Algorithm**
The core of Greykite’s architecture is the **Silverkite algorithm**. It combines traditional statistical models like ARIMA with features typically used in machine learning, such as handling holidays and external events.
- **Linear Model Framework**: Silverkite uses a linear model, but it is flexible enough to include seasonality, holidays, and other event-based effects through feature engineering.
- **Lasso Regularization**: For feature selection and reducing overfitting, the Silverkite model leverages **Lasso** regularization.
- **Automatic Seasonality Detection**: Detects weekly, monthly, and yearly seasonality patterns automatically based on historical data.
  
### 2. **Flexible Feature Engineering**
Greykite offers highly flexible **feature engineering** techniques, including:
- **Time Features**: Automatically generates time-related features (hour, day of the week, month, etc.).
- **Holiday and Event Features**: Integrates holiday effects, promotions, and other events into the forecast.
- **External Regressors**: Greykite allows users to add additional covariates (like weather, traffic, etc.) as external regressors to improve forecasting accuracy.

### 3. **Model Explainability**
Greykite emphasizes model interpretability by providing insights into:
- **Feature Importance**: Ranking of time-related features, holidays, and external regressors.
- **Decomposition of Effects**: Breaks down the contribution of each component (seasonality, holidays, trends) to the final forecast.

- **Event Markers**: Allows manual or automated inclusion of special events that impact forecasts.

### 3. **Model Diagnostics and Debugging**
Greykite provides in-depth diagnostic reports that help:
- Identify issues in the model performance.
- Examine how holidays, seasonality, or trend components affect the forecasts.
- Detect outliers and anomalies in data that might be influencing results.

### 4. **Uncertainty Estimation**
Greykite offers uncertainty estimates for each forecast, helping businesses assess risk. This is particularly useful in areas like supply chain management and financial risk forecasting.

## Greykite's Forecasting Workflow

The **forecasting workflow** in Greykite typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean, scale, and transform input data.
   - Handle anomalies, missing values, and outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Automatically generate time-related features (day, week, month, holidays).
   - Include external regressors such as weather or traffic if relevant.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Use the default Silverkite algorithm or select from other models like AutoARIMA or ETS based on the nature of the data.
   
4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the selected model by fitting the data, and adjusting for seasonality, trends, holidays, and regressors.

5. **Forecast Generation**:
   - Generate point forecasts for future time steps along with uncertainty intervals.

6. **Model Diagnostics**:
   - Diagnose the model using built-in tools and reports to check performance and debug errors.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune parameters for optimal model performance through validation techniques.
